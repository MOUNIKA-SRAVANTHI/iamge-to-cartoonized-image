# iamge-to-cartoonized-image
This Python project leverages the power of OpenCV to transform real-world images into stylized cartoons. By applying techniques such as color quantization, edge detection, and smoothing, the application effectively captures the essence of the original image while imparting a unique cartoonish aesthetic.

Key Features:

Image Preprocessing:
Reads input images using OpenCV.
Reduces the color palette through color quantization.
Identifies edges using Canny edge detection.
Cartoonization:
Smooths the image using Gaussian blur.
Combines the smoothed image with detected edges for a cartoon-like effect.
Outputs the stylized cartoon image.
User-Friendly Interface:
Intuitive interface for easy image selection and parameter adjustment.
Real-time visualization of original and cartoonized images.
Convenient saving option for the cartoonized image.
